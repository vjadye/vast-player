# vast-player
A debug tool based on google IMA to play VAST responses over a content video

This is a simple tool built on top of Google IMA SDK to play VAST responses in the browser. You can either enter a VAST XML markup or a URL that returns VAST XML markup in the tool.

Note: If you use a URL that returns VAST XML markup, please ensure that the server adds CORS headers in the response.
